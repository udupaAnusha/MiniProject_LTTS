# Requirements

## Introduction:

* The Impact of Coronavirus pandemic has affected both the economic activities as well as human lives. Lockdown has made our lives miserable by not able to socializing.
* An attempt is made to analyze the impact and possible solutions for some key sectors like food and agriculture, aviation, telecommunication, tourism etc.
* Just like that the idea of going out to the restaurants and nearby cafes has also been not possible until now, but an idea of online food ordering directly to your home is the ideal solution in such pandemic situations. 
* My project meets the customer needs by fulfilling their cravings giving home deliveries 24/7.

## Research:

### Features:

* The main features of the project includes the customer ordering the food online by his choice of hotel/cafe, including the favourite item from the menu of his choice.
* After deciding with the menu, the customer can even check his cart for the total bill.
* Each customer is given an option to create his/her own account before processing the order.
* The login and signup option is provided for the authentication purposes.

### Benefits:

* **Greater reach from the restaurant side:**  There is a possibility of the food reaching to thousands of customers just by opting for online delivery. The restaurant's seating capacity maybe very minimum say 100-200, but catering to a much large number of people than this is surely a plus point in the business.
* **Monitoring the expenses:**   This is the greatest benefit of the online ordering system, it gives precise information about the cash flow in the restaurant. It can keep the track of all the costs and the profits occurred.
* **Makes the ordering process easier:**   Traditionally, people had to make calls to place orders or drive to the restaurants for a take-out, then wait for the food to be prepared and delivered. Sometimes, placing an order on the phone means that there could be mistakes in order. Clearly, these aren't really the best solutions to order food from restaurants especially for people with busy lifestyles. The best solution is switching over to online ordering. 

### Key Factors:

* **Cost:** One time investment on the online system gains profits at it's maximum level.
* **Time:** Saves time in all the manual bill transactions and calculations, serving and waiting tables say manpower, can serve multiple orders at a time.

## Functionalities:

**1. SignUp and Login:**  The main function signup validates the inputs given in creating a new account of the customer with the username, email, password, phone number etc.
Some of the rules to be followed inorder for the system to successfully validate the account like username containing alphabets, mobile number with 10 digits etc. After successful validation, the customer can login and search the hotels and foods.
